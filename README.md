# FP learning resources
A collection of good learning resources for FP stuff (handpicked by @layflags and me :-) )

## Elm

- [The official Elm language guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/): Very nice for programming beginners and FP newbies.

## FP in general

- [Prof. Frisby's mostly adequate guide to functional programming](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/): Great informative and entertaining book about the basics of functional programming. Perfect for people coming from JavaScript.

## Haskell

- [The Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/): Good book targeted at beginners for learning Haskell which tries to make it easy to learn this notoriously hard-to-learn language, successfully. It's costs a bit but is wortht the price for really explaining things in an easily digestible way. There are some sample chapters [here](http://haskellbook.com/assets/img/sample.pdf).
